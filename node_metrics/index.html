<p>The Node Validator Service is a general purpose relay service that watches
data flow from the Hot Shot protocol via the CDN pub sub service. It
maintains a local state of the network map and is able to relay the
stored details to any client that requests it. In addition it is also
able to provide individual state change updates to any client that
subscribes to that particular event stream.  In order to be able to
provide identity information to the clients, this identity information
must be volunteered by the nodes in the network.  This requires the
nodes to be able to receive and respond to these requests, and relay
to anyone who desires it, the identity information of the node.</p>
<h3 id="storage"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#storage">Â§</a>Storage</h3>
<p>In order for this service to be effective and efficient it needs to be
able to store the state of the network in an efficient manner.  The
storage should be fast and efficient.  We are not expecting a lot of
data to be stored within this storage, but as things tend to grow and
change it may be necessary to have more robust storage mechanisms in
place, or even to have the ability to introduce new storage mechanisms.
In order to effectively store the data that we need to store, we need
to ask a fundamental question:</p>
<p>What states do we need to track?</p>
<ol>
<li>Node Information
a. Node Identity Information
b. Node State Information (specifically voter participation, latest block
information, and staking information)</li>
<li>Network Information
a. Latest Block
b. The most recent N blocks (N assumed to be 50 at the moment)
- Information can be derived from these most recent 50 blocks
that allows us to derive histogram data, producer data, and
the most recent block information.  We might be able to get away
with just storing the header information of these blocks, since we
donâ€™t need the full block data.
c. The most recent N votes participants
d. The top block producers over the latest N blocks
e. Histogram data for the latest N blocks
- Block Size
- Block Time
- Block Space Used</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="data-streams"><a class="doc-anchor" href="#data-streams">Â§</a>Data Streams</h3>
<p>In order for clients to be able to receive the information from the node
validator service, we need to be able to facilitate requests.  We could
simply just start streaming data to the clients as soon as they connect,
however, this causes potential compatibility issues with the clients
in question.  For example, if we want to add a new data stream that
can be retrieved for the client, and the client isnâ€™t expecting it, they
wonâ€™t know how to handle the data, and it can potentially cause errors.
As such, it makes sense to only provide data streams when the client asks
for them.  This allows for new features to be added to the data stream
without breaking compatibility with the clients, provided that the existing
streams donâ€™t change in a way that would break the client.</p>
<p>Starting out, there doesnâ€™t need to be a lot of data that needs to be
streamed to to the client.  In fact, we might be able to be a little
naive about this, and broadcast general objects in an event stream, as
data may be derivable from the objects that are broadcast.  For example,
if we start out by sending the latest N block information, the client
may be able to derive histogram data from that information, which would
prevent us from having to send and store the histogram data.  However,
there may be some pieces of data that are lacking from this approach which
would require us to send out additional data streams.</p>
<p>Ideally, we should strive for a balance between the data we store locally
and the data that we stream to the clients. In order to know what we
need to store, we need to know what data we are expecting the client to
consume, and which data can be derived for these purposes.</p>
<p>What Data Streams do we need to provide to clients?</p>
<ol>
<li>Node Information
a. Node Identity Information
- Should be able to be sent in an initial batch
- Should be able to send individual updates as they occur
b. Node State Information
- Should be able to be sent in an initial batch
- Should be able to send individual updates as they occur
c. Block Information
- Should be able to be sent in an initial batch
- Should be able to send individual updates as they occur</li>
